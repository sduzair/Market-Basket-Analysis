# Market Basket Analysis

## What Is Market Basket Analysis?

Market basket analysis is used by companies to identify items that are frequently purchased together. Notice, when you visit the grocery store, how baby formula and diapers are always sold in the same aisle. Similarly, bread, butter, and jam are all placed near each other so that customers can easily purchase them together. The technique uncovers hidden correlations that cannot be identified by the human eye by using a set of statistical rules to identify product combinations that occur frequently in transactions.

Apart from market basket analysis, other popular applications of data science in marketing include churn prediction, sentiment analysis, customer segmentation, and recommendation systems.

## How Does Market Basket Analysis Work?

Market basket analysis is frequently used by restaurants, retail stores, and online shopping platforms to encourage customers to make more purchases in a single visit. This is a use-case of data science in marketing that increases company sales and drives business growth and commonly utilizes the Apriori algorithm.
